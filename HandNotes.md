## What is a Network? *Day-0*
- An overview:<br><img src="https://i.ibb.co/GHg8grL/Overview-of-a-Network.png">
- A **switch** simply allows us to connect more than two computers/devices.
- A **router** will help two network talk:<br><img src="https://i.ibb.co/m4S0k0Z/Switches-plus-Router.png">
- **Internet** is simply the combination of routers and switches:<br><img src="https://i.ibb.co/mcTcyHH/Internet.png">
- A **firewall**'s job is to block anything that shouldn't come through or go out and only allow the good stuff:<br><img src="https://i.ibb.co/YdM3g9m/Firewall.png">
- **WAP:** Wireless Access Point:<br><img src="https://i.ibb.co/Y0D79SB/WAP.png">
- Even though we have all these marked stuff (WAP, Switch, Router, Firewall, Modem) in one box, things must be in seperate way in companies thanks to they possess lots of people and lots of valuable data
- ***PS:*** *Network Controllers and Servers will also be covered along with the stuff seen above*

## What is a Switch? *Day-1*
- In order to better understand how smart switches are we need to take a look at its successor: ***Hub***
- Hub send the received package not only to the aimed one but everyone on the network; simply that's why hub sucks and is not smart.<br><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bgws2gt/Hub.png">
- A hub's job is just to repeat the electrical signal as seen above.
- A **ping** message is used to see if the other computer or server is up and can be reached.
    >``` ping 10.1.2.3 ```
- **L2 Address**: MAC Adress
- **L3 Address**: IP Adress
- **Switch** on the other hand transmits the message solely to the desired one.
